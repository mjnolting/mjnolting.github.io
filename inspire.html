        <h2>The GOAT</h2>
        <p>Roger Federer is described as the peRFect tennis player. From his elegance and grace, to his excelent shot making ability, Roger Federer was the king of tennis, and an inspiration to many, including me.</p>
        <p>Roger Federer is great for many reasons, but the reason he is one of my heroes is because of the way he carried himself on and off the court. Roger is a very humble tennis player, in victory and defeat. He also carried himself on the court in a way not like other players. Roger rarely showed his frustrations on the court while most other players did, and he had a strong mental game. That is something I was lacking when I first started tennis and started watching him play. He inspired me to act like him on the court which is why he became my tennis idol.</p>
